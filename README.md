Architecure Diagram: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Kdz_9xdI5osGZPDPGFbb5GNC8VAh5xtsRH_oBl-vIxs/edit?usp=sharing 


# Combined/Updated TO DO (as of 4/26 9am)
1) all child location classes should be fully built out and cases added to main so that their functionality can be used
ALSO go through and make sure methods like fight(), buildShelter(), buildFire(), etc, are overwritten in places where they should NOT be used (or should be used differently)

    - ANNA: classes built **YES** 
            added to Main **YES**
            help overwritten **YES**
            other Island methods overwritten **PART**
    - SHARMILA: classes built ___ 
                added to main ___ 
                help overwritten ___
                other Island methods overwritten ___
        - also architecture diagram update

    - **help is abstract in Island rn, is that good or?
    - AIMEN: 
            Changing strategy for moving between locations- hard code new location objects when game starts and change all move methods to return these exisiting locations and not new instances **In Progress**
            Rewritting help() **In Progress**
            Starting to write game ending events based on luck **In progress**


3) write game endings and luck-related events- resuce, volcanic eruption, other deaths, etc

4) make pop up graphic for map at the mountain peak

5) play game and make sure we meet all rubric requirements (see 'rubric.md' and below) ALSO address all question comments and add javadocs and other comments for the purpose of being graded

Mtg Notes 4/18

General thoughts / questions
1) any method that will be useful in more than one location class should be implemented in Island
    *may require having exceptions in the child classes if certain things do not apply in one location

2) will the movement set up work? should we be creating new instances of the loc classes with each movement?
    **ask prof

3) for the purposes of getting graded we are prob gonna need a lot more comments explaining what everything does... prob javaDocs too

To-Do For Week 2:
1) Drafted code base and annotated architecture diagrams due
2) Finish action methods in Island and all child locations
    - all shared methods in Island (Aimen)
    - finish child classes (NS, SS, M/C/W, DF, LF) (Anna, Sharmila)
3) start working on game play stuff
    - action / movement tracking for logging days
    - luck points and game endings (resuce, volcano, death, etc)
    - adding cases to accept all necessary input and to call all possible methods that have been implemented in the locations
4) eventually learn how to make pop up graphic for mtn peak map!
